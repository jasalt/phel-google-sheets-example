Phel example for interfacing with Google Sheets API
# Usage

1) Ensure `phel` (0.19.1+) Phar distribution is in path (WIP docs https://github.com/phel-lang/phel-lang/pull/835)
2) Install Composer dependencies with `composer install`
3) TODO Setup credentials

Run main namespace with `phel run main.phel` or evaluate code with `phel repl`.

## About project structure
While there's [cli-skeleton](https://github.com/phel-lang/cli-skeleton/) and [web-skeleton](https://github.com/phel-lang/web-skeleton) projects, this project uses more minimal project structure expecting Phel Phar installed as `phel` in PATH.
